# Covid-Aki-in-hospitalized-patients
Early findings have linked AKI and other renal problems to coronavirus illness 2019. (COVID-19). AKI happened in 399 hospitalized COVID-19 patients; some required dialysis, and half died in the hospital. Some of the patients who were discharged had not recovered to baseline renal blood flow at the time of discharge. AKI is frequent in COVID-19 patients and is linked with a greater mortality rate than in patients without AKI; of those who survive, only about a quarter are released with renal recovery. These findings may aid centers in resource planning and preparing for the extra load caused by survivors of COVID-19-associated AKI who do not restore kidney function.
